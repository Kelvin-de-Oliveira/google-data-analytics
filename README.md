# Google Data Analytics Certificate Repository

This repository serves as a central location to store all my progress, summaries, and certificates from the **Google Data Analytics Certificate** course. I am participating in this program through a scholarship granted by **CIEE + Google**.

The course is structured into **8 modules**, and for each module, there is a dedicated folder containing:
- A **summary** of the key topics and concepts studied in the module.
- The **certificate of completion** for that module.

For the **final module**, the folder will also include the **solution to the final project**, demonstrating the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course.

Currently, I have completed **4 modules** and am actively working through the remaining ones.

This repository will be updated as I progress through the course and complete each module.
