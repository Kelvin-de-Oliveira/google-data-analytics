# Course Summary

The course **“Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions”**, offered by Google via Coursera, focuses on developing structured thinking, analytical problem-solving, and effective communication skills for data-driven decision-making. It emphasizes asking the right questions, designing dashboards, and applying spreadsheet tools across the data lifecycle.

## Content and Learning

### 1. Problem-Solving and Analytical Thinking

The course begins by exploring the **problem-solving roadmap** and its importance in the data analysis process. Learners discover that data analytics is not just about processing information, but about solving real-world problems creatively and systematically.

**Six common problem types:**
* **Making predictions:** Using past data to forecast outcomes (e.g., predicting effective advertising channels).
* **Categorizing things:** Classifying data points to identify patterns (e.g., grouping customer feedback).
* **Spotting something unusual:** Detecting anomalies (e.g., recognizing abnormal health data trends in smart devices).
* **Identifying themes:** Finding broader insights across multiple data categories (e.g., analyzing user behavior patterns).
* **Discovering connections:** Uncovering relationships between datasets (e.g., linking delivery delays to hub locations).
* **Finding patterns:** Detecting recurring trends in datasets (e.g., maintenance delays linked to machine failures).

### 2. Asking SMART Questions

Learners explore how **SMART questions**, **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ction-oriented, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound, can guide meaningful analysis and problem-solving.

**Examples of SMART questions:**
* What features are most important to customers when purchasing a car?
* How does four-wheel drive affect a car’s perceived value?
* What features would increase the likelihood of purchase within the next three years?

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
* **Leading questions:** Bias responses toward a specific answer.
* **Closed-ended questions:** Limit responses to “yes” or “no.”
* **Vague questions:** Lack clarity or context.

### 3. Dashboards and Data Visualization

Learners gain experience in designing and interpreting dashboards: powerful tools for monitoring live data, visualizing trends, and communicating findings.

**Dashboard benefits:**
| For Data Analysts | For Stakeholders |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Centralized data source | Unified view of metrics and goals |
| Real-time data visualization | Faster trend recognition |
| Cross-dataset insights | Clear understanding of data stories |
| Customization by audience | Focus on relevant details |

**Tools covered:**
* **Tableau** — used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
* **Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets)** — for data organization and analysis.

**Dashboard creation process:**
1. Identify stakeholders and their data needs.
2. Design clear layouts with headers and short descriptions.
3. Create mockups or drafts.
4. Choose appropriate visualization types (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts).
5. Apply filters to focus on specific subsets of data.

### 4. Big Data vs. Small Data

Learners explore differences between **big** and **small** data and how each serves different analytical needs.

| Small Data | Big Data |
|-------------|-----------|
| Short, specific time periods | Long-term, large-scale datasets |
| Usually analyzed in spreadsheets | Stored in databases, queried with SQL |
| Easier to collect and visualize | Requires more resources and processing |
| Used by small to midsize businesses | Used by large organizations |

**Three (or four) Vs of Big Data:**
* **Volume:** Amount of data.
* **Variety:** Types of data.
* **Velocity:** Speed of data processing.
* **Veracity:** Reliability and quality of data.

### 5. Spreadsheets in the Data Lifecycle

Spreadsheets play a vital role across all **six stages of the data lifecycle**:

* **Plan:** Set data organization standards.
* **Capture:** Connect spreadsheets to live data sources.
* **Manage:** Store, organize, and filter datasets securely.
* **Analyze:** Use formulas, pivot tables, and charts for insights.
* **Archive:** Store historical data for future use.
* **Destroy:** Remove outdated or sensitive data securely.

### 6. Data-Driven Decision-Making

The course highlights how **data-inspired decision-making** integrates quantitative and qualitative insights to support business objectives and stakeholder goals.

**Example:** A marketing team uses dashboard data to measure campaign performance, identify top-performing strategies, and adjust future initiatives based on measurable outcomes.

## Skills Gained

By the end of this course, learners gain skills in:

* Analytical and structured thinking
* Problem-solving and stakeholder communication
* Asking SMART and effective analytical questions
* Dashboard design and data visualization
* Spreadsheet-based data analysis and reporting
* Understanding big data and small data applications
* Data-driven and evidence-based decision-making

## Conclusion

This course helped me strengthen my foundation in data analysis by enhancing my structured thinking, problem-solving, and visualization skills. I gained hands-on experience in asking the right questions, designing dashboards, and using spreadsheet tools, which has been essential for my growth as a data-driven decision-maker in professional settings.
