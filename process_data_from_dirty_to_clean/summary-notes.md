# Course Summary 

The course **“Process Data from Dirty to Clean”**, part of the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**, focuses on transforming raw, inconsistent, and inaccurate data into clean, reliable datasets ready for analysis. It guides learners through the principles of data integrity, practical data-cleaning techniques using spreadsheets and SQL, and methods for validating and verifying cleaning results.

## Content and Learning

### 1. Understanding Data Integrity

Learners explore the concept of **data integrity** and the risks that can compromise it, such as replication errors, data transfer issues, or incorrect manipulation. The course emphasizes maintaining accuracy, completeness, consistency, and validity across all datasets.

**Key integrity constraints:**
* **Data type:** Values must follow predefined formats (e.g., date, number).
* **Range:** Data must fall within valid limits.
* **Uniqueness:** No duplicate identifiers.
* **Mandatory fields:** Required information cannot be blank.
* **Cross-field validation:** Values across related fields must align logically.
* **Accuracy & Completeness:** Data must reflect reality and include all necessary components.

**e.g.:** Standardizing date formats across global datasets ensures that 12/10/20 isn’t misread as December 10, 2020, instead of October 12, 2020.

### 2. Managing Data Quality Issues

The course addresses how to identify and resolve **data problems**, such as missing, insufficient, or incorrect data. It introduces practical strategies like using **proxy data** when the desired dataset is unavailable or too small and emphasizes judgment when deciding whether to exclude erroneous data.

**Common data issues and solutions:**
| Problem | Example Solution |
|----------|------------------|
| No data | Use proxy datasets or collect a sample. |
| Too little data | Combine datasets or narrow analysis scope. |
| Wrong data | Recommunicate requirements and correct at the source. |

Learners are also introduced to **open and public datasets** (e.g., Kaggle) as valuable resources for analysis and practice.

---

### 3. Sampling and Statistical Foundations

Learners gain foundational knowledge about **sample size determination**, **confidence levels**, and **margins of error**, core statistical concepts in reliable data analysis.

**Key terms:**
* **Population:** The full group under study.
* **Sample:** Subset representing the population.
* **Confidence level:** Probability that results reflect the population.
* **Margin of error:** Expected difference between sample and population results.

**e.g.:** When surveying employees, a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error ensure that results accurately represent the workforce.

### 4. Identifying and Cleaning Dirty Data

The course defines **dirty data**: Incomplete, inconsistent, duplicated, or outdated information, and explores its causes and business consequences.

**Types of dirty data:**
* **Duplicate:** Repeated entries due to manual input or import errors.
* **Outdated:** Old data that no longer reflects reality.
* **Incomplete:** Missing essential information.
* **Incorrect:** Human or system-generated errors.
* **Inconsistent:** Variations in format or structure.

**Business impact:** Dirty data leads to flawed insights, revenue loss, and poor decision-making, especially in industries like finance, healthcare, and marketing.

---

### 5. Data Cleaning Best Practices and Tools

Learners practice **data-cleaning workflows** in spreadsheets and SQL, using built-in tools and formulas to identify, correct, and prevent errors.

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**
* Ignoring spelling or format inconsistencies
* Overlooking missing or misfielded values
* Failing to back up data before cleaning
* Not documenting errors or changes
* Losing focus on project objectives

**Spreadsheet techniques:**
* **Conditional formatting:** Highlight blanks or anomalies.
* **Remove duplicates:** Automatically delete repeated rows.
* **SPLIT, TRIM, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, CONCATENATE:** Clean and manipulate strings.
* **COUNTIF & LEN:** Identify outliers and validate data length.
* **Pivot tables & charts:** Summarize and visualize data quality issues.
* **VLOOKUP:** Combine information across sheets for verification.

---

### 6. SQL and Data Transformation

Learners compare **spreadsheets vs. SQL databases**, understanding when each is appropriate:
| Spreadsheets | SQL Databases |
|---------------|---------------|
| Small datasets | Large-scale data |
| Manual entry | Automated queries |
| Built-in visuals | High-speed processing |
| Individual work | Team collaboration |

Basic **SQL functions** are introduced to clean and format data, emphasizing the use of **string operations** and **type conversions** for consistency.

---

### 7. Verifying Data Cleaning Results

The course presents a **data-cleaning verification checklist** to ensure final datasets are reliable and aligned with project goals.

**Checklist items:**
* Check for **NULLs**, duplicates, and misfielded values
* Ensure consistent **data types**, **date formats**, and **column labels**
* Validate business logic (e.g., revenue > 0)
* Review project goals to confirm alignment

Learners also practice maintaining **changelogs** and using **version control** systems to document, review, and revert data transformations responsibly.

---

### 8. Advanced Cleaning Functions and Automation

Advanced spreadsheet functions like **IMPORTRANGE**, **QUERY**, and **FILTER** enable automation, synchronization, and efficient data extraction from multiple sources. These tools mimic SQL’s **SELECT** and **WHERE** capabilities, supporting scalable data-cleaning workflows.

**e.g.:** Using IMPORTRANGE to automatically update a dataset of daily transactions from an external source ensures data consistency without manual copying.

---

### 9. Strengthening Technical Skills

Finally, the course highlights key **technical skills** for aspiring data analysts:
* **SQL:** Querying and cleaning databases.
* **Spreadsheets:** Manipulating and organizing data.
* **Data visualization tools:** Communicating insights effectively.
* **R/Python:** Programming for advanced analysis (optional for beginners).

---

## Skills Gained

By completing this course, learners develop practical skills in:

* Ensuring and maintaining **data integrity**
* Applying **SQL** and **spreadsheet functions** for data cleaning
* Identifying and correcting **dirty or inconsistent data**
* Calculating **sample size** and **margin of error**
* Using **queries and formulas** to automate cleaning
* **Verifying and documenting** data-cleaning processes
* Building **technical proficiency** in analytical tools
